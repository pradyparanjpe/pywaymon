SYNOPSIS
*********

.. argparse::
   :ref: pywaymon.command_line._cli
   :prog: pywaymon

***************
Custom modules
***************

Each custom module can be called from the command line with a sub-command argument as indicated :ref:`above<SYNOPSIS>`.

Modules may have various pre-formatted tooltips as indicated (if available) in their respective sections.
The initial type of tooltip may be supplied using the tip-type argument ``-t``.
Unless supplied, the configured tip-type is used.
If unconfigured, standard tip-type is used.

.. _daemon_call:

Daemon
=======

If called with the interval argument ``-i``, *pywaymon* enters an infinite loop emitting output with an interval of supplied seconds.
We shall refer to such an instance as the `daemon` mode.
If not called with an ``-i`` argument, *pywaymon* defaults to the configured value, else emits only one test output and exits.
If value supplied with ``-i`` is ``0``, *pywaymon* does not enter daemon mode even if `configured <CONFIGURATION.html#loop-interval>`__; instead, emits only one test output and exits.

Comm
=====
While a `daemon` instance of any module is running in a loop, another `comm` instance may be called to manage the daemon.
Following arguments **imply** *comm* mode.

*pywaymon* called with refresh argument ``-r`` sends a *refresh* instruction to manually update the module before it's time.

*pywaymon* called with push argument ``-p`` with an integer value pushes the tip state in forward direction if value is positive or in reverse direction if value is negative.

.. warning::

    *pywaymon* **may not** be called with ``-i`` argument in comm mode.

.. _MODULES:

Modules
=======

Following custom modules for waybar are defined.

---
- Monitors disk Input/Output wait times.

tip types
^^^^^^^^^^
- combined: disks + pids [default]
- pids: top consumer processes
- disks: disk IO

processor
----------
- Monitors CPU usage.

tip types
^^^^^^^^^^
- combined: processors + pids [default]

netio
------
- Monitors incomming and outgoing networking data.

netcheck
---------
- Check and classify type of network.
- When IP(v4) address of host machine starts with ``192.168``, it is hidden.
