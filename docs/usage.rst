   :prog: pywaymon

***************
Custom modules
***************

Each custom module can be called from the command line with a sub-command argument as indicated :ref:`above <SYNOPSIS>`.

Modules have various pre-formatted tooltips as indicated in their respective sections if available.
The initial type of tooltip may be supplied using the tip-type argument ``-t``.
Unless supplied, the configured tip-type is used.
If unconfigured, standard tip-type is used.

Daemon
=======

If called with the interval argument ``-i``, *pywaymon* enters an infinite loop emitting output and waiting for supplied seconds.
We shall refer to such an instance as the `daemon` mode.
If value supplied with ``-i`` is ``0`` (default), *pywaymon* does not enter ther daemon mode; rather, emits only one test output and exits.

Comm
=====
While a `daemon` instance of any segment is running in a loop, another `comm` instance may be called to manage the daemon.
Following arguments **imply** *comm* mode.

Comm called with refresh argument ``-r`` sends a *refresh* instruction to manually update the segment before it's time.

Comm called with push argument ``-p`` with an integer value pushes the tip state in forward direction if value is positive or in reverse direction if value is negative.

.. warning::

    Comm **may not** be called with ``-i`` argument.

List
=====

Following custom modules for waybar are defined.

^^^^^^^^^^
- combined: disks + pids [default]
- pids: top consumer processes
- disks: disk IO

processor
----------
- Monitors CPU usage.

tip types
^^^^^^^^^^
